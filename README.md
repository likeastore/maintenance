# Maintenance
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/likeastore/maintenance.png)](https://travis-ci.org/likeastore/maintenance)

Express.js middleware for easy switching the app to maintenance mode.

## Description

Deployment of new version of app or patching the database, could cause the need to put application to `maintenance` mode before all operations are completed. Typically, it's just a page with description of what's happening and when service is going to be restore.

For REST API's, it's required to send a meaningful HTTP code and description.

`maintenance` provides middleware and http-endpoint for putting application to maintenance mode.

It supports 2 modes of work:

* configuration-based (require redeployment of app)
* hot-switch mode (put to maintenance without redeployment)

In configuration-based mode, you should provide the `flag` signaling the application on maintenance mode and restart the application:

```js
var config = {
	maintenance: true
};

maintenance(app, config.maintenance);
```

Hot-switch is could more convenient since doesn't require re-start. And could be controlled by HTTP:

```bash
# put app to maintanance
HTTP POST http://youapp.com/maintenance?access_key=[SHARED_SECRET_KEY]

# back to normal
HTTP DELETE http://youapp.com/maintenance?access_key=[SHARED_SECRET_KEY]
```

By default, if application in maintenance mode, it would render `views/maintenance.html` view.

## Usage

Install `maintenance` from npm,

```bash
$ npm install maintenance
```

Update your application,

```js
var maintenance = require('maintenance');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	console.log(req.url);
	res.send(200);
});

maintenance(app);
```

Specifying the initial mode,

```js
// starts the app in maintenance mode
maintenance(app, true);
```

or take from config,

```js
// starts the app in maintenance mode
maintenance(app, config.maintenance.current);
```

or use options,

```js
maintenance(app, {httpEndpoint: true, api: '/api'});
```

## Options

Instead of initial you can customize `maintenance` with options object,

```js
var options = {
	current: true,						// current state, default **false**
	httpEndpoint: true,					// expose http endpoint for hot-switch, default **false**,
	url: '/app/mt',						// if `httpEndpoint` is on, customize endpoint url, default **'/maintenance'**
	accessKey: 'xx4zUU8Cyy7',			// token that client send to authorize, if not defined `access_key` is not used
	view: 'myview.html',				// view to render on maintenance, default **'maintenance.html'**
	api: '/api',						// for rest API, species root URL to apply, default **undefined**
	status: 503,						// status code for response, default **503**
	message: 'will be back'				// response message, default **'sorry, we are on maintenance'**
};

maintenance(app, options);
```
